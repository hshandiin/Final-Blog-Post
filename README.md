For my final project I decided to extend my original sketch I did on depicting the concepgts of male and female rain. I really enjoyed working on that project and I wanted to make it a piece that was more informing for the viewers. To do this I extended the sketch by adding more of a conceptual framework to my art. Instead of just a static sketch, I build a site around it. On my site the viewer can access the stories of rain, which inspired my animation piece. The viewer can also enjoy a time lapse visual of a rainy day in Din√©tah (Navajo land). Moreover, there is access to more cultural stories, should the viewer feel even more curious after seeing my piece. I wanted to combine the new skills I have obtained in this class with creating a sketch and building a site to dispplay our work. I think this pieces exemplifies that combination as well as the combination of my education and my culture.
